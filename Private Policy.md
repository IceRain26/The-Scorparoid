## 3. How We Use Your Data
Feature Enhancement: We use the data to improve bot functionality, troubleshoot issues, and enhance user experience.

Temporary Processing: Data such as message content is processed temporarily for feature execution (e.g., responding to a command). It is not stored after the process is complete.
